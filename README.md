# Vite Template Setup

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the Vite development server on your machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this project into a **fresh directory**:

```bash
git clone <repository-url> vite-template
```

### 2. Navigate to Project Directory

Change into the project directory:

```bash
cd vite-template
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install all required packages:

```bash
npm i
```

### 4. Start Development Server

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will start and provide you with a local URL (typically `http://localhost:5173`). Open this URL in your browser to view your application.
